       <h2>Hi, my name is Mila</h2>

       <p>
           I am a young Johannesburg-based African multimedia design graduate trying to break into
           a make dominated industry. I am passionate about storytelling
           from the perspective of women and providing authentic stories
           about women by women
       </p>
        <p>
            I am looking to champion and shed light on women and explore
            how narrative, different art mediums, lighting and camera techniques can 
            enhance them and their stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to sketch out my storyboards before translating them
            into photographs, collages and sometimes film. I will be sharing them and letting 
            you in on my creative process from the conception to the 
            final product so you can maybe share my love for the magic 
            of creating beautiful and authentic stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Milani means to be firm in faith in isiXhosa and I believe 
            that this is a beautiful manifestation to base my website 
            on. Although the idea of putting myself out there is 
            daunting, I believe in this work and hope you will too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you get to enjoy this journey with me and that we 
            can create connections - between you and me and you and 
            my work - along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I look forward to growing through each project and interacton.
            This site was made with love and I hope you continue to feel 
            that love throughout. 
        </p>
