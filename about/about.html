       <h2>Hi, my name is Buko</h2>
       <section>
           I am a young African film graduate trying to break into
           a make dominated industry. I am passionate about storytelling
           from the perspective of women and providing authentic stories
           about women by women

            I am looiking to champion and shed light on women and explore
            how narrative, language, lighting and camera techniques can 
            enhance them and their stories.

            I like to sketch out my storyboards before translating them
            into photographs and film. I will be sharing them and letting 
            you in on my creative process from the conception to the 
            final product so you can maybe share my love for the magic 
            of creating beautiful and authentic stories.

            Milani means to be firm in faith in isiXhosa and I believe 
            that this is a beautiful manifestation to base my website 
            on. Although the idea of putting myself out there is 
            daunting, I believe in this work and hope you will too.

            my work - along the way.
