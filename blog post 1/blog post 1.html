    <h1>HOW WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED IN ART</h1>

    <article>
        <p>
            When I think of well known artists, my mind thinks of Picasso, Salvodor Dali, 
            Basquiat, Andy Warhol and several other famous men. Before actively becoming 
            interested in art, the only well known female artist I could identify was 
            was Frida Kahlo. However, I have noticed that there is no shortage in art 
            that has women as the subject. Women are constantly being portrayed from 
            the viewpoint of men and female artists are not given enough platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            These observations became the driving force behind by subject matter and 
            the recurring themes in my art. We need more stories about women that have 
            been told by women. We also need narratives that are not just rooted in 
            trauma or being sexualised but in being seen as a multi faceted person.

            The piece I am currently working on explors how camera techniques can 
            tell different stories. There are various shots that illustrate different mooods. 
            They inlude:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Extreme Close-up Shots, Medium Shots and Full Shots 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have established this, you decide what type of focus you 
            would like in your image. The focus can be: 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Shallow Focus, Deep Focus or Soft Focus
        </p>
        <p>
            Another consideration is the camera angle. Examples of angles can be:
        </p>
        <p>
            - Low, Shoulder or Eye Level Angles
        </p>
        <p>
            I like using low angles for portarits so we can look up at the subject. I like 
            accentuating features such as the jawline and cheekbones and I feel that 
            the light catches these feature beautifully from a low angle with a deep 
            focus. When I am doing collages that require full body reference image, 
            I like to use long shots with a softer focus so that the focus can be more 
            on the silhouettes rather than specific features on the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my quest to lift women up and celebrate them, I have made the decision 
            to actively seek and engage with work made by women. This is why I decided 
            to share a list of prolific contemporary female artists from Harper&apos;s Bazaar. They inspired me 
            in a whole new way and I hope they inspire you too.
