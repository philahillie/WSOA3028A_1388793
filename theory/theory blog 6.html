            The content I have read on the web, its conception and the tools 
            that help it run efficiently have been interesting because most of 
            them were written before the World Wide Web was launch and are abstract 
            in style. For example, the idea on which thw web was founded on was to 
            be a source of information and arcive knowledge at volumes that the 
            human brain could not. This idea is similar to that of the library 
            and thus redaings such as &quot;The Library of Babel&quot; help explain 
            the concept of the web in a way that is understandable by people who are 
            not just in the computer science community. In fact, the conceptualisation 
            of a space in which a large amount of information could be stored and live 
            longer than humans was initally rejected by scientists and encouraged 
            by philosophers and librarians such as Jorges Luis Borges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, Borges writes about Dr Ts&apos;ui Pen, a man 
            whose ideas around creating a space in which possible outcomes are endless 
            and thus a story can have multiple endings were not taken seriously by his 
            family. His family wished to discard his findings when he died but the 
            publishers and people from different cultural backgrounds and locations 
            saw value in his work. I feel that this reading speaks to the fact that 
            the web is now full of a large volume of information, some of which may be 
            useful to some and not useful to others. I think this point ties in with 
            the idea of metadata, a tool that helps users access information that is 
            useful to them. This also has ties with hypertext which is &quot;human-authored 
            media that can branch or perform on request&quot;. Hypertext works on the idea 
            that you can create associations between media that can lead you to more information 
            about the media that you were previously reviewing. Hypertext responds to 
            human actions the same way the stories and their potential endings respond 
            to the requests of the reader. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the other recurring themes of the set readings is the idea of 
            the web being referred to as an artwork or medium which content can be 
            shared on. Marshall McLuhan made the statement that &quot;The Medium 
            is the Message&quot; and this can influence the way information or content 
            is viewed and/or shared. Dr Ts&apos;ui Pen&apos;s work was not regarded as useful 
            to his family because it had been presented in what looked like loose pages 
            of thoghts that wre not cohesive or complete however, the Englishamn who 
            read the book on his ideas was able to understand the idea that was being 
            communicated. McLuhan stated that the &quot;message of any medium or 
            technology is the scale or pace or pattern that is introduced into 
            human affairs&quot; and this can be seen in the reception of Dr Pen&apos;s 
            work before and after publication.

            When I intially thought of the web, I thought of technology and systems 
            that could not be understood by people who were not in that profession. 
            Seeing the early conceptualisation of the web in abstract and fictional 
            stories and essays has humanised the web and highlighted the one main goal 
            of the web; to act as an archive for information that can live longer than 
            humans.
