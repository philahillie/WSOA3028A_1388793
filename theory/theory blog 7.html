    <section>
        <p>
            My character is Mila and she is trying to start a company called "Milani 
            Media House", a multimedia design house in which she shares her creative 
            process as an artist, her growing career and participation in projects 
            in Johannesburg and the research she has done along the way. She is 
            based in Johannesburg and her work explores the intersection between 
            growing up in Johannesburg while having cultural roots in the rural 
            Eastern Cape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Promoting her work and creating a safe digital space for women of colour 
            is important for her. She does this through discussing topics that affect 
            women of colour and also by giving practical insight and advice for people 
            looking to pursue a career in art and digital art. She is passionate 
            about women and women of colour taking up more physical space.
        </p>
        <p>
            My characterâ€™s necessity was born out of the need to have digital designers 
            who understand, care and cater for the needs and interests of women of 
            colour who may have access to online content but have not been given the 
            same platform and opportunities to contribute to online content and represent 
            themselves through their own eyes as opposed to through the gaze of people 
            looking into their community. She produces content and also advises her 
            viewers on the challenges that come with creating content and websites.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Mila wants to shed light on her experiences as an up and coming artist in 
            the South African work environment and in the Johannesburg art scene. 
            Her art is inspired by her Xhosa culture and diverse and unique 
            Johannesburg energy that she grew up in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Milani&quot; means &quot;firm in faith&quot; in isiXhosa and this 
            speaks to the objectives of the design house and to Mila as a person as it 
            is her full name. Mila has faith in herself as an artist and in women and the 
            stories they have to tell.
