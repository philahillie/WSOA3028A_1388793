        <p>
            My character&apos;s name is Mila and she is trying to start a company called 
            &quot;Milani Media House&quot;, a multimedia design house in which she shares 
            her creative process as an artist, her growing career and the things she has learned 
            along the way. She is based in Johannesburg and her work explores the intersection 
            between growing up in Johannesburg while having cultural roots in the rural Eastern Cape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mila is a feminist and is passionate about giving women; particularly 
            women of colour; a platform and a chnace to see stories about women that have 
            been told by women. She believes that South Africa&apos;s creative industry 
            is saturated with men and stories from their perspective and she would like to 
            use her digital space to archive and celebrate the work and stories of women.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mila aims to do all of this by sharing her work, the work of women who 
            inspire her and give advice to other upcoming female artists as she understands 
            the value of sharing the highs and lows of a growing career as an artist. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While the goals of Milani Media House are personal to Mila, they are 
            also geered towards getting more professional opportunities and gaining more 
            eperience in the creative field and this platform could help direct 
            the work into the right hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Milani&quot; means &quot;firm in faith&quot; in isiXhosa and this 
            speaks to the objectives of the design house and to Mila as a person as it 
            is her full name. Mila has faith in herself as an artist and in women and the 
            stories they have to tell.
