                Information geographies can be described as information that is mediated by networks, 
                infrastructures and technologies; all of which exist in physical and material places 
                and operate within a specific context. They are important because they shape how we 
                are able to access information about different parts of the world. Information has 
                always had geography and is mobile. What is also important to note is that information 
                and the history of production of information has always had a relation to underlying 
                tones of power as there is a clear divide in who is able to access and create content 
                versus who can only access information about the world. This has resulted in an 
                imbalance of representation and contributions between the global North and global 
                South regions.

                &quot;Towards a Study of Information Geographies&quot; makes mention of immutable mobiles 
                and this refers to information that can be transported without significant change to 
                its meaning and content. A map is an example of this. A map can be rendered in various
                 ways but the information pertaining to the locations it signifies will always stay 
                 the same. Another example of an immutable mobile is the printing press as the 
                 production is low cost and it is able to transport information through the &quot;container&quot; 
                 that is the paper. The paper is simultaneously limiting in how its form can change 
                 in the same way the form of a map is limited in how its form can change. A key 
                 characteristic of immutable mobiles is their ability to illuminate the informational 
                 layers of places in a moveable container to create &quot;particular geographies of 
                 information&quot;. They impact representations of places that are used both in the 
                 locales referenced and in other parts of the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Further research on information geographies stated how information can represent 
                regions the same way physical maps can. It also mentions how geographic information 
                is a &quot;systemic source of representation&quot; and this makes me think about the system 
                misrepresentation of oppressed groups of people such as black people, African people, 
                queer people and women and how the lack of content created by these communities is 
                linked to their geographies and access to information. People use information to solve 
                problems and describe the worlds and experiences they come from and to communicate 
                with others. When barriers are put up, it becomes difficult for people to be able to 
                play a part in representing themselves and their communities and adding to digital 
                archives. Barriers such as accessibility to computers and the cost of broadband 
                internet in the global North versus the global South make it harder to distribute 
                information. Graham et al. Mentions how the cost of broadband internet in the global 
                South can cost between 20% and 250% of a person&apos;s income whilst it costs under 10% 
                of person&apos;s income in the majority of nations in the global North. The disparities 
                in access only contribute to the digital divide and imbalance in access to information. 
                The systemic nature of information and geography also imply a relationship between 
                the reduced production and access to information and regions that are plagued by 
                spatial inequalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al. mentions &quot;pre-digital technologies&quot; and how information was scarce 
                and difficult to disseminate. When formalized education in information handling 
                processes was introduced, the ability to access information that had had been 
                organized was restricted. Pre-digital technologies were unable to surpass the 
                materiality of medium or the world. Books, newspapers and novels were more likely
                 to be published in the global North and the global South played a minor role in 
                 producing information and sharing it with the world. This contributed to the 
                 imbalanced power dynamics between the North and South. When looking at Africa, 
                 Castell goes on to say that &quot;most of Africa is being left in a technological 
                 apartheid&quot; and this is because the continent plays a minor role in disseminating 
                 information that informs people about the space and place and thus is under 
                 represented. There is also a relationship between the low rate of production of 
                 information and socio-economic exclusion and marginalization in regions in the 
                 global South. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Information revolution&quot; and &quot;data revolution&quot; signify radical changes in the ways 
                information is produced and used. They imply that we are in an age of &quot;post-information 
                scarcity&quot; and systems are strengthened by a greater accessibility to computers that 
                can readily receive and transmit information from anywhere in the world by way of 
                those machines. Information can now be accessed and produced digitally and this has 
                resulted in citizens being able to play a bigger role in creating content and 
                deciding what content they wish to consume. This is an example of the &quot;democratic 
                power of the internet&quot;. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al. look at information geographies from three angles – the geographies of 
                access and enablement, the geographies of participation and the geographies of 
                representation. The geographies of access explore who has access to the technologies 
                and services essential for digital communication, participation and representation. 
                Studies show that most of the countries in Europe have internet penetration rates of 
                80% or higher and also show that over 20 sub-Saharan African countries have an internet 
                rate of less than 10%. It also highlights the disparities in access to broadband 
                internet connect with Africans having to pay between 10% and 250% of their income in 
                order to access information that is online while European, North and South American 
                countries pay up to 10% of their incomes to access the internet. Studies also 
                highlight how the average incomes of African people are considerably lower and 
                this can have an effect on their ability to pay for broadband internet access.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographies of participation interrogate where digital information is generated. 
                Graham et al. looked at three variables – domain names, Github users and Wikipedia 
                edits. Domain names are an indication of content produced on the open Web are able 
                to provide the locations of digital content. It was determined that large internet 
                populations did not directly translate into a large number of domain registrations 
                and that there was a difference in how many people consumed information versus how 
                many people created and distributed information. In the case of Github – the largest 
                code hosting service in the world – the majority of users were from the United States 
                (31%). In the case of Wikipedia – the largest and most used encyclopedia – the 
                greatest levels of participation and content creation were in the global North 
                and Africa&apos;s contributions were insignificant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographies of representation look at which parts of the world content is created 
                and not created in and studies showed how African and Latin America were each 
                represented by less than 5% of the world content on Open Server Maps and how 
                California&apos;s representation was the equivalent to almost the whole continent 
                of Africa. The mathematical and digital spaces are related to the digital 
                information spaces and this can be seen through the lack of information on 
                African maps and spaces compared to that of the American spaces.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important for me to create content that speaks to who I am as a woman and 
                an African so that information can reach people who can then have a better 
                understand of African digital and physical spaces. The perk of digital space 
                is its ability to decrease geographical distance and to store information that 
                can be accessed by people from all over the world. I can only hope to play a 
                small part in representing a small portion of my physical context and distributing 
                that information for others to see and learn from.
