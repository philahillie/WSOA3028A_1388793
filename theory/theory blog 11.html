            <p>
                Information geographies can be described as information that is mediated by networks, 
                infrastructures and technologies; all of which exist in physical and material places 
                and operate within a specific context. They are important because they shape how we 
                are able to access information about different parts of the world. Information has 
                always had geography and is mobile. Information and the history of production of 
                information has always had a relation to underlying tones of power as there is a 
                clear divide in who is able to access and create content versus who can only access 
                information about the world. This has resulted in an imbalance of representation 
                and contributions between the global North and global South regions.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Further research on information geographies stated how information can represent 
                regions the same way physical maps can. It also mentions how geographic information 
                is a &quot;systemic source of representation&quot; and this makes me think about the system 
                misrepresentation of oppressed groups of people such as black people, African 
                people, queer people and women and how the lack of content created by these 
                communities is linked to their geographies and access to information. People 
                use information to solve problems and describe the worlds and experiences 
                they come from and to communicate with others. When barriers are put up, it 
                becomes difficult for people to be able to play a part in representing themselves 
                and their communities and adding to digital archives. Barriers such as 
                accessibility to computers and the cost of broadband internet in the global 
                North versus the global South make it harder to distribute information. Graham 
                et al. Mentions how the cost of broadband internet in the global South can cost 
                between 20% and 250% of a person&apos;s income whilst it costs under 10% of person&apos;s 
                income in the majority of nations in the global North. The disparities in access 
                only contribute to the digital divide and imbalance in access to information. The 
                systemic nature of information and geography also imply a relationship between the 
                reduced production and access to information and regions that are plagued by spatial 
                inequalities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al. mentions &quot;pre-digital technologies&quot; and how information was scarce 
                and difficult to disseminate. When formalized education in information handling 
                processes was introduced, the ability to access information that had had been 
                organized was restricted. Books, newspapers and novels were more likely to be 
                published in the global North and the global South played a minor role in producing 
                information and sharing it with the world. This contributed to the imbalanced power 
                dynamics between the North and South. When looking at Africa, Castell goes on to 
                say that &quot;most of Africa is being left in a technological apartheid&quot; and this is 
                because the continent plays a minor role in disseminating information that informs 
                people about the space and place and thus is under represented. There is also a 
                relationship between the low rate of production of information and socio-economic 
                exclusion and marginalization in regions in the global South.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Information revolution&quot; and &quot;data revolution&quot; signify radical changes in the ways 
                information is produced and used. They imply that we are in an age of &quot;post-information 
                scarcity&quot; and systems are strengthened by a greater accessibility to computers 
                that can readily receive and transmit information from anywhere in the world by way 
                of those machines. Information can now be accessed and produced digitally and this 
                has resulted in citizens being able to play a bigger role in creating content and 
                deciding what content they wish to consume. This is an example of the &quot;democratic 
                power of the internet&quot;.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham et al. look at information geographies from three angles – the geographies of 
                access and enablement, the geographies of participation and the geographies of 
                representation. The geographies of access explore who has access to the technologies 
                and services essential for digital communication, participation and representation. 
                Studies show that most of the countries in Europe have internet penetration rates 
                of 80% or higher and also show that over 20 sub-Saharan African countries have an 
                internet rate of less than 10%. It also highlights the disparities in access to 
                broadband internet connect with Africans having to pay between 10% and 250% of 
                their income in order to access information that is online while European, North 
                and South American countries pay up to 10% of their incomes to access the internet. 
                Studies also highlight how the average incomes of African people are considerably 
                lower and this can have an effect on their ability to pay for broadband internet 
                access. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographies of participation interrogate where digital information is generated. 
                Graham et al. looked at three variables – domain names, Github users and 
                Wikipedia edits. Domain names are an indication of content produced on the 
                open Web are able to provide the locations of digital content. It was determined 
                that large internet populations did not directly translate into a large number 
                of domain registrations and that there was a difference in how many people 
                consumed information versus how many people created and distributed information. 
                In the case of Github – the largest code hosting service in the world – the 
                majority of users were from the United States (31%). In the case of Wikipedia – 
                the largest and most used encyclopedia – the greatest levels of participation 
                and content creation were in the global North and Africa&apos;s contributions were 
                insignificant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Geographies of representation look at which parts of the world content is created 
                and not created in and studies showed how African and Latin America were each 
                represented by less than 5% of the world content on Open Server Maps and how 
                California&apos;s representation was the equivalent to almost the whole continent 
                of Africa. The mathematical and digital spaces are related to the digital 
                information spaces and this can be seen through the lack of information on 
                African maps and spaces compared to that of the American spaces.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important for me to create content that speaks to who I am as a woman 
                and an African so that information can reach people who can then have a better 
                understand of African digital and physical spaces. The perk of digital space 
                is its ability to decrease geographical distance and to store information that 
                can be accessed by people from all over the world. I can only hope to play a 
                small part in representing a small portion of my physical context and 
                distributing that information for others to see and learn from.
