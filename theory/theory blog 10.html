            Digital Inequalities can be seen as the differences in structures that 
            are put in place to give people access to the internet and technology. 
            They are reflective of the existing socioeconomic, infrastructure and 
            education environments of underprivileged communities and present 
            challenges that can affect all aspects of one&apos;s life from being able 
            to work remotely to being able to engage with social media platforms

            Christoph Lutz discusses how there are three levels of divides present 
            and explains how they affect people and how they could be improved. The 
            first divide looks at the unequal access to the internet. There is a lack of 
            theory-based research into how the internet can be accessed and run efficiently 
            in different ways or forms other than the computer. For example, many people 
            do not have access to a computer but can access the Internet through their 
            mobile devices. However, due to the lack of theoretical research, a focus has 
            not been placed on creating websites that can be engaged with efficiently on 
            the phone. While cellular banking and certain online shops have accommodated 
            their users, a focus has been placed on making social media accessible on 
            phones rather and thus other traditional sites that are not flexible or consume 
            a large amount of data on phones.

            Lutz also mentions how devices such as portable speaks or Siri are one 
            dimensional because they have limited outputs â€“ playing music and voice 
            activation. He also mentions how language barriers often stop these devices 
            from performing well and this then potentially excludes people who do not 
            speak English.
