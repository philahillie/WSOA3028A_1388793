        <p>
            The term &quot;hypertext&quot; was first coined by Theodor &quot;Ted&quot; Nelson 
            and was described as human-authored data that can branch or perform on 
            request. The concept of the ypertext has varying definitions for different 
            fields and has its own history outside of a Web context.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the literary community, hypertext can be considered a direct connection 
            from one position in a text to another. This definition mentions the idea 
            of a link and this is the first one that came to my mind; the act of 
            linking two web pages to one another through a word, phrase or image. 
            Early iterations of the hypertext looked at how words in books could physically 
            be linked to another word that is several pages forward or backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the computer science community, hypertext can be defined as hypertext-as-interaction 
            with information to uild associations and through associations to build 
            knowledge. This definition reminds me of Jorge Borges' &quot;The Library of Babel&quot; 
            and how the hexagonal libraries were interconnected. It reminds about 
            the principles that the web was founded on which is to store knowledge. 
            This means that hypertext aids in the building of knowledge. While the 
            defintion does not mention a link, the &apos;associations&apos; used 
            to build knowledge can be seen as links and a way of connecting one 
            source of knowledge to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Differing intellectual communities have their own interpretations 
            of hypertext because the name &apos;hypertext&apos; is simply a word 
            that was theorised by Ted Nelson. This means that it did not have a defintive 
            meaning before Nelson used it in his research paper. If one wants to 
            truly understand what hypertext is, one has to understand what it means 
            to different intellectual communities and also understand its history.

            I understand hypertext to be a function that lead you to more information 
            about the media or text that it has been attached to. For example, in my 
            website, I have attached previews of my blog posts with hypertext or 
            hypermedia &apos;links&apos; to lead you to the full article. This is my 
            way of associating two piece if information to one another and giving the 
            viewer a choice on whether they would want more information the 
            opportunity to spend less time on information they are not interested 
            in and more time to find something else they might like. Hypertext can also 
            be seen as a tool that helps with navigation as the viewer can be brought 
            forwards and backwards to where they were.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want my website to have a focus on visual so I would love to make use 
            of hypermedia and hypertext to be able to show visuals but allow viewers 
            to learn more about the visuals through hypertext. I believe that 
            the visual associates itself with the text in a hierarchal structure.
