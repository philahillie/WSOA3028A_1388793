                User experience (UX) refers to &quot;The overall experience a person has when using a 
                product such as a website &quot;, and its ultimate goal is to create a pleasing experience 
                for the user. The difficulty in user experience design is the potential disconnect 
                between the intentions of the designers and the actual experiences of the users. 
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field based in the design of computer technology 
                and how people interact with it and it looks at how efficient this technology can 
                be for its users. HCI research is mostly focused on the &quot;achievement of behavioural 
                goals in work settings&quot; and the task at hand becomes the focus of their analysis. 
                It is concerned with the value of the product. UX design steers away from this 
                because it identifies beauty and how the users feel when experiencing websites into 
                a greater consideration. UX argues that beauty fulfils a human need and thus it 
                has value despite it being perceived as non-instrumental. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hassenzahl argues that HCI needs to be more concerned about the pragmatic aspects 
                of interactive products such as its behavioural goals, the personal growth and 
                increase of knowledge and skills of the user and aspects of identification and 
                evocation such as self-expression, interaction with others and memories. A single 
                negative interaction can have a negative impact on an agent&apos;s wellbeing and this 
                begs the question, is it possible to design in a way that prescribes the emotions 
                a user is supposed to feel? Hassenzahl argues that it might be easier to create a 
                context in which a selection of emotions can be felt by the user and I agree with 
                this. As an artist, when you create an artwork, you cannot predict what the viewers 
                might feel when looking at your work but the artwork itself creates a context for 
                the viewer to feel a range of emotions. When looking at my website and the use of 
                red, ne could interpret the colour as passion, energy, confidence or even danger.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiential perspective of UX places a focus on two aspects of technology 
                use; its temporality and its situatedness. An experience is a unique combination 
                of various elements such as the product and internal states of the user such as 
                their mood and expectations. The experiential aspect of technology combines the 
                experience of the users with the goals of the website to create an overall experience. 
                For example, when creating an artwork and subsequentially displaying it in a gallery, 
                the artwork and space in which it will be displayed work together to create an overall 
                experience for viewers. A physical context has been created to the viewer&apos;s range 
                of emotions and opinions on the work and space.  
            </p>
            <p>
                UX encompasses both practise and research and through this practise, designers 
                have been able to see that UX allows for more than functionality and shifts the 
                parameters of demand for interactive products. It is driven by commercial vendors, 
                designers who are wishing to push the barriers of web design and the scientific 
                community who have shown an interest in the way beauty and experience can relate 
                to cognition.
