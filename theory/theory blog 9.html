    <h1>ACCESSIBILITY &AMP; USABILITY ON THE WEB</h1>

    <article>
        <p>
            Accessibility on the web speaks to &quot;the discriminatory aspects related to the user experience 
            for people with disabilities&quot;. Usability on the web speaks to &quot;designing products that are efficient 
            and satisfying to users&quot;. Unfortunately, when websites are designed, accessibility and usability 
            are not regarded as integral to the initial development of websites and are forced into the designed 
            website instead of accommodated for from the beginning of the design process. Accessibility addresses 
            making websites that can be engaged with by people who have physical and cognitive disabilities.   
        </p>
        <p>
            When researching the suggestions that forums such as the Web 
            Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG) had recommended, my 
            mind was suddenly exposed to design considerations that my privilege 
            had shielded me from. For example, there are fonts that are being 
            developed that will make it easier for people with dyslexia to read. 
            I was also made aware of how important consistency and hierarchy in 
            the layout of web pages is. This includes a consistent navigation menu 
            in which the page links are placed in the same order on every page.   
        </p>

            It is important for people with disabilities to be involved in the design 
            process so they are able to give valuable input into what needs to be on 
            the website in order for it to be as accessible as possible. People with 
            disabilities should be able to access your website with or without Assistive 
            Technology. The WCAG consists of a set of guidelines and rules for creating 
            accessible web pages. These guidelines show us how to consider accessibility 
            in web pages regarding a range of disabilities like physical, visual, auditory, 
            speech, language, cognitive and neurological disabilities.  
        </p>
        <p>
            While accessibility can be addressed graphically and in the user experience on 
            the user&apos;s side, it can also be incorporated into the technical design of 
            the web pages through the use of metadata. This includes adding descriptions to 
            the visuals you are using and adding microformats such as an h-card that will allow 
            for your website and information about it to appear easily when people search for 
            it on browsers. Usability addresses how one can easily consume the content on your 
            website in the most efficient way.   
        </p>

            The Easy-to-Read (E2R) is a method that looks into writing text in a form that is 
            easy to read and easy to understand. The involvement of users in the design process 
            is vital and the target groups give reviews. An efficient layout will be one with 
            consistent navigation, clear and short sentences with elaborated text and a clear 
            separation between the content and navigation. The presence of a search function that 
            is able to support the location of single words or articles is encouraged. Medium-sized 
            font that is scalable is preferred over small font and the font should be clear and bold. 
            This is why websites tend to have a sans-serif font.  Pictures and patterns that clash 
            with the background and text should also be avoided.

            My website has a focus on visuals as it showcases my art and the art of people I 
            admire. Whilst there is theory and text, I have decided to keep it minimal and lay 
            out the visuals and text in a way that does not clash or confuse viewers. The website 
            is also very clear in its colour palette and mainly uses black and white to help with 
            contrast and visibility.
