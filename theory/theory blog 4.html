        &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot; highlights how the meaning of 
        an artwork or content is in the medium or platform that it has been 
        shared through as opposed to the content shared. When thinking of the 
        web and the various platforms that are available for one to share content 
        on, one cannot ignore the fact that different digital platforms cater 
        to specific content and thus aid in the dissemination of said content.

            Marshall McLuhan discusses how a medium can &quot;change the scale and/or pace&quot; 
            of content and how it is introduced to us and says that the focus should 
            be on what one does with the machine as opposed to the machine itself. 
            When I think of how this theory could be applied in everyday life, I think 
            about the various digital platforms that exist and how we are subconsiously 
            aware of which platforms serve the varying content we wish to share. When 
            we have visual content we want to share, we post on Instagram; when we 
            have thoughts we wnat to share, we tweet them on Twitter and when content 
            creators want to share videos longer than a minute, they look into sharing 
            those videos on YouTube. These digital platforms can be used for functions 
            outside of what has been mentioned but there is a chance that the content 
            will be received differently and will have less impact.

            McLuhan mentions how the electric light can be seen as a medium and 
            the objects or activities it illuminates can be seen as the content. 
            He discusses how the content is often seen as the medium as it is 
            at the forefront but the content cannot exist without the medium the same 
            way a brain surgery is not possible without the lights that help the 
            surgeons see what they are doing. Similarly, the web is the medium beacuse 
            without it, content as we know it today, cannot be shared or accessed instantly.

            As a multimedia artist who is trying to share her work on a digital 
            platform, I have debated if there is value in creating a personal 
            website to share my work when there are existing &quot;free&quot; digital 
            platforms with millions of users and account holders. One of the benefits 
            that first come to mind is the ability to display y work in the format I 
            wish instead of having to conform to the grid structure of Instagram. 
            While Instagram is a valuable platform for gaining followers, a website 
            could be a valuable platform for creating a more personal voice and image. 
            I believe that my Instagram account could breathe life into my website 
            and they could exist as two complimentary spaces.

            My artwork and thoughts are the content and my medium is the Web. The 
            web is a digital space in which information is stores and shared instantly 
            and my content is being stored on Instagram and this website, both of 
            which are digital spaces that act as archives.
