    <p>
    In this design phase, I explored how I could keep the design simple but interesting as 
    I was struggling to master the balnce between simple and effective versus empty and bland. 
    I have decided that the logo should be in line with the navigation bar so that there is 
    not too much empty space at the top of the web page. I believe that this populates 
    the page while still keeping it light due to changing the heading font to be a bit lighter.

    I also want to add a footer so that I can attach contact details and the branding and trademark 
    so I can give the website a more professional feel.
