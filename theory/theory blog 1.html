            Jorges Luis Borges was a librarian whose explorations of infinite  
            sources of information and possibilities that can transcend time and  
            space can be seen as an early conceptualisation of the World Wide Web 
            and the Internet.

            In &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, Borges describes a world which 
            is made up of interconnected, hexagonal libraries whose boundaries  
            cannot be defined. Each library is made up of four sides that contain  
            twenty bookshelves. He describes how eah book is different from the  
            other and that the difference in titles could be distinguished by a  
            single letter or punctuation mark. The titles may or may not describe  
            the contents of the books and this is what makes them significant to  
            the history of man. Borges states that the books aim to solve &quot;riddles&quot; 
            that were once unsolvable by man but cannot solve and provide answers  
            for everything.

            This piece of writing describes the idea on which the internet was  
            founded on; to serve as a historic archive and organise human knowledge. 
            The internet was an exploration of how poeple think and communicate. 
            Borges describes the center of the libraries as hexagonal in shape  
            and this is consistent with the desriptions of the internet as non-linear. 
            The interent is a &quot;global system of interconnected computer networks&quot; 
            similar to the interconnected hexagonal libraries. They both combine  
            the thoughts of millions and puts them in one boundless place.

            &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; is a short story about an Asian 
            man who finds an Englishman who has been studying his late grandfather&apos;s 
            work. His grandfather, Dr Ts&apos;ui pen, spent the last years of his life
            writing a novel that had an infinite number of possibilities. His family 
            asumed the novel had not been completed as they could not understand that 
            the reader could choose the fate of the characters in the novel. The novel 
            was about a labyrinth that was assumed to not have been completed by his 
            grandson as he could not navigate or make sense of the map. His grandson 
            mentioned how surprised he was that the work of his Chinese grandfather was being 
            studied and understood by the Englishman.

            The internet blurs national and international barriers and this can be seen 
            in its accessibility and its ability to be translated into multiple languages. 
            Information can also be shared by people across the world and that information 
            then lives on the internet.

            &quot;As We May Think&quot; discusses using computers to process information, 
            the hypertext, the memex and the web. Tim Burners-Lee, the creator of the 
            World Wide Web, brought together the elctronic document, hypertext, markup 
            and the internet to create a new paradigm. Bush expressed how a mechanised 
            library could solve problems with the amount of time it took to access 
            information and he rate of production of information. The mcahnised library 
            would increase searching speed and allow for more knowledge to be acquired 
            by viewers. Bush refers to this device as a memex. The information 
            would be able to be stored at a greater volume and life span than that 
            of humans.
