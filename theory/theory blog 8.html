            I recently started reading about African Feminism within the digital space 
            and was so happy to see that work on how we can reclaim the narratives of 
            women, non-binary folk and the LGBTQIA community on the Internet is being 
            investigated. Sheena Magenya wrote an article' &quot;Making a Feminist Internet 
            in Africa&quot;, that discusses the relationship Africans have with access to 
            the internet, innovations made through the internet and how we are represented 
            on he internet. She states that Africa is seen as a continent that needs 
            technology and innovative ideas to solve existing problems such as famine, 
            disease and drought instead of a continent where technology and innovation 
            can be used for fun.

            I resonate with this statement because, as an artist, I feel the pressure 
            to create work that highlights existing issues that affect women as opposed 
            to creating work that is centred around exploring artistic techniques and 
            softwares that can create abstract works or products. There is an assumption 
            that a female artist&apos;s work must highlight the violence and oppression that 
            women endure and their persevering nature and I would love for women to be given 
            the freedom to explore a range of different avenues of subject matter.

            Magenya talks about how, although digital spaces have given women and the 
            LGBTQIA community a platform to be seen and heard, they also mirror the 
            violent and discriminatory nature of physical spaces. This statement reminds 
            me of the #MenAreTrash movement where feminists were discussing how men are 
            complicit in the violent behaviours of their peers because they do not 
            speak out against perpetrators they know personally. It should also be 
            noted that accessibility to the Internet is still a privilege and thus 
            mirrors the unequal world we live in. Data prices in South Africa are 
            alarmingly high and the rate at which the Internet consumes said data makes 
            accessing the Internet and sharing content on the Internet extremely expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is power in being able to access stories and work that is reflective 
            of your life and told through a voice that is similar to yours and that 
            is why there is great value in championing feminism on the Internet. It 
            is vital for African women, non-binary folk, the LGBTQIA community and 
            people with disabilities to take up physical and digital space and initiatives 
            such as the &quot;Making a Feminist Internet&apos; gathering and the &quot;Feminist 
            Principles of the Internet&quot;are needed to make it possible.

            I have attached a link to the <a href="https://feministinternet.org/en/event/making-feminist-internet-movement-building-digital-age-africa">&quot;Feminist Principles of the Internet&quot;</a> 
            to this blog post. The website states that they are a movement interested in creating 
            safe spaces for African feminists to exist in and contribute to.
