    <img src="../images/theory blog 1.png" class = "blogImage" alt="connecting hexagons with a marked pathway">
    <article>
        Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentine librarian whose explorations of 
        infintite sourcs of information, history and possibilities that
        can transcend time and space can be sen an an early conceptualisation
        of the World Wide Web and the Internet.

      <img src="../images/user generated content.png" class = "blogImage" alt="Hands typing on a laptop with social media icons">
      User-generated content can be defined as data, information or media that 
      is contributed to the web by ordinary people. In recent years, user-generated 
      content has seen rapid growth and an increase in value as it entertains its 
      consumers, is usually relatable in its nature and is easily accessible 
      to its users.

        <p class= "flex-paragraph"></p>
            The term &quot;hypertext&quot; was first coined by Theodor &quot;Ted&quot; Nelson 
        and was describd as human-authored media that can branch or perform on request. 
        The concept of the hypertext has varying definitions for different fields 
        and has its own history outside of a Web context.

    <img src="../images/MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE.png" class = "blogImage" alt="an envelope with paint marks on a canvas with paint marks">
       &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot; highlights how the meaning of an artwork 
       or content is in the medium or platform that it has been shared through 
       as opposed to the content shared. When thinking of the web and the various 
       platforms that are available for one to share content on, one cannot ignore 
       the fact that different digital platforms cater to specific content and 
       thus aid in the dissemination of said content.

    <img src="../images/Hypertext.png" class = "blogImage" alt="information icons linking">
       Metadata can be defined and abstracted into several meanings but, 
       at its core, it is information about other information. Metadata describes 
       and gives more information about an object.

       The content I have read on the web, its conception and the tools that 
       help it run efficiently have been interesting because most of them were 
       written before the World Wide Web was launched and are abstract in style.
