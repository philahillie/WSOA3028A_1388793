   <img src="../images/MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE.png" alt="an envelope with paint marks on a canvas with paint marks">

       &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot; highlights how the meaning of an artwork 
       or content is in the medium or platform that it has been shared through 
       as opposed to the content shared. When thinking of the web and the various 
       platforms that are available for one to share content on, one cannot ignore 
       the fact that different digital platforms cater to specific content and 
       thus aid in the dissemination of said content.

   <article>
       The content I have read on the web, its conception and the tools that 
       help it run efficiently have been interesting because most of them were 
       written before the World Wide Web was launched and are abstract in style.
