            The Implicit Bias Test was created by Harvard&apos;s Project Implicit 
            several years ago. Its aim was to measure social attitudes and 
            beliefs that people may or may not be willing to realise. The test 
            has various categories such as a race test, a gender test and a test 
            that interrogates potential biases against age groups that differ 
            from our own. I took the age and weigh test to see what type of 
            questions they would ask and was surprised to see how binary the 
            approach to the questions were. I also found that although the test 
            states that it is interrogating implicit biases (biases that are present 
            but not consciously recognised), one cud argue that the way in which 
            the questions were posed required you to be conscious or aware and 
            &quot;decide&quot; what option you preferred. This makes me question whether 
            it is accurate to describe the test as one that records your subconscious 
            biases.

            When looking further into the implications of implicit biases, 
            I found an article that mentioned Amazon, their artificial 
            intelligence matching (AI matching) software and how it was 
            found that the technology held an unfair bias towards women. 
            In 2018, Reuters deduced that Amazon&apos;s AI matching software 
            had biases against women and that although Amazon claimed 
            their recruiters did not rely on the rankings of the system, 
            they admitted to considering them. The presence of biases in 
            software and machines that are supposed to have no opinion is 
            possible because these systems are developed and coded by 
            humans who have implicit biases that influence the way they 
            create and engage with the world. Additionally, a study showed 
            that IT teams such as those of Google and Microsoft are 80% 
            comprised of men and this subsequently influences the way in 
            which software is biased against women.   
        </p>
        <p>
            When matching technology is created, rules around how it will 
            work are developed by the developing teams. An example of this 
            would be when a team wants to hire employees that can perform 
            the way their top performing employees do and thus matching 
            software that analyses the resumes of applicants and other 
            information that employers find relevant and compare it to 
            that of their existing employees. If potential employees are 
            compared to existing ones in work environments that are 
            male-dominated, one could argue that the initial set of rules 
            that are developed will already be coded in favour of men and 
            at a disservice to women because their resumes and other 
            information that interests their male employers will not compare 
            to that of a male applicant. It has also been said that weight 
            is given to certain words.

            One of the main reasons I started Milani Media House is because 
            I was struggling to get a job. Initially, I thought it was 
            only because I was a recent graduate and therefore a risky 
            hire but I am starting to see that many more factors potentially 
            play a role in why a women (and particularly a women of colour) 
            will struggle to get hired in South Africa, a male and white 
            dominated economy in which biases against race, gender and age 
            ultimately play a role a significant role in your application 
            process.
