            The fourth pahse of my wire frame design included making the backround colour for the navigation 
            menu black with white text and how I could practically aplly the colour scheme to the 
            lyout of the pages.In the previous designs, I struggled with making the website simple but BOLD and 
            this fourth iteration looks at allowing the colours o really pop on the page through sortng the articles 
            into containers that change colour when the cursor hovers over them. This also allows for a more effient view 
            of the articles to come. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the branding has become a bigger focus and the articles and pages have been clearly marked
            out and are accessible. The illustrations also help with visual aesthetics and make the site more enjoyable.
