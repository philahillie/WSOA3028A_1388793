            User-generated content can be defined as data, information or media 
            that is contrbuted to the web by ordinary people. In recent years, 
            user-generated content has seen rapid growth and an increase in value 
            as it entertains its consumers, is relatable in nature and is easily 
            accesible to its users. User-generated content transitions from a traditional
            one-to-many approah to content style to a many-to-many. An example of 
            this transition would be author&apos;s books being published and sold in 
            stores to people sharing their thoughts on platforms such as social 
            media.
        </p>
        <p>
            The promise of user-genrated content is that it seeks to get as many 
            users as possible involved with creating content and engaging with the 
            platforms that the content has been posted to. It also allows for the 
            knowledge to be more accessible and, through the contributions of users, 
            allows for more information to be on the web. Users are generally not 
            motivated by the idea of being compensated for their contributions but 
            rather see it as an act of sharing with their respective communities.
            This also results in the presence of high quality content on accessible 
            digital platforms.  
        </p>
        <p>
            When looking at my own content and how I would share it, the first platform 
            I gravitated towards was Instagram. This is because I can share my visual 
            and allow for a safe community of followers who share the same interests 
            of seeing more stories about women and seeing the behind the scenes life 
            of a female storyteller. 
        </p>

            Another point of conflict for craeting accounts for my media house was 
            aknowledging that these accounts would essentially be business accounts. 
            While there is more data and statistics on how businesses can use user-generated 
            content to promote and optimise their content and engagement with customers, 
            there is no direct formula that will calculate and guarantee success with users. 
            The Balance between remaining vernacular; local and/or familiar; in content, 
            language and accessibility whilst still acknowleding that I am promoting a 
            business is something I have to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also been researching what sharing my work online would mean with 
            regards to other people being able to share and adpat my work into their 
            own creations and I believe that this is the one peril of user-genrated 
            content and its accessibilty. The social media platforms I share my work on 
            can transfer or sublicense my work for money and it is hard to keep track 
            of users who share and adapt my work therefore infringement of intellectual 
            property falls into a grey area. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I do believe that authorship is powerful and that, while my content 
            could be adapted and reshared by many users, people will still credit who 
            their adapted content is from due to the sense of community on digital 
            platforms. This means that I can still reach a lot of people, create 
            content that is accessible and engaged with easily and whose life can 
            be extended through the resharing and adaptation of my work.
