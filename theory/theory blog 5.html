            Metadata can be defined and abstracted in several meanings but, 
            at its core, it is information about other information. When the 
            word metadata is broken down, &quot;meta&quot; refers to a 
            &quot;higher level of abstraction&quot;. This means that metadata 
            describes and gives more information about an object. A practical 
            example of metadata would be how one chooses which novel they want 
            to read based on metadata such as the title, the cover art, the author, 
            or the blurb. These elements give a potential viewer information about 
            the book and they purchase said book based on that as opposed to the 
            content within the book. When metadata is designed well, it fades into 
            the background and its presence is &quot;invisible&quot; to users.

            The idea of metadata can be linked to the idea of a library. Human 
            beings were unable to go through all the pages in the library to find 
            the information they were looking for as this wasted time. This resulted 
            in the introduction of the catalogue. The catalogue was a much 
            friendlier user interface that acted as a map in which books were 
            organised and given a symbol that corresponded with its location on 
            the map. The library was able to have information organised so that users 
            could acces the specific information they were looking for. When we 
            look at the web today, it can be said that metadata helps search engines 
            provide users with the specific information they are looking for.

            This is useful for my website because I want users to be able to see my 
            work if they are looking for art or for my work specifically. From my 
            understanding, the idea is to code my website in such a way that search 
            engines can understand what my website is about and what content it 
            contains. I also want my website to be more accessible and this can be 
            done through using metadata to desribe all of the content on my site. 
            For example, I would add descriptions to all the media that I attach 
            but these descriptions will not show on the actual media, instead, they 
            will appear if my media is unable to load.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without descriptions about objects and content, content would become 
            &quot;indistinguishable&quot; from the vast amount of information within 
            digital space. Metadta makes your information easier to locate and helps 
            your website run efficiently the same way traffic and electrical grids help 
            cities run smoothly.
