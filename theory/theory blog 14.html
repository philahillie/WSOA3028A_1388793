            <p>
                I recently read a research paper that looked at the tragic rape and murder of a 
                Dutch teenager named Marianne Vaastra in 1999. The murder case took twelve years 
                to solve and brought into question the need for forensic DNA technologies, 
                how ethical they are and how the speculations and findings were related to 
                racial profiling. When the investigation into Vaastra&apos;s murder first began, 
                because the crime happened within close proximity to a centre for asylum seekers 
                from Iraq and Afghanistan, Dutch residents and even an officer speculated that 
                the perpetrator would be from that community. Although the gathering of DNA for 
                forensic identification was initially seen as a violation of the rights of people, 
                this information help produce data that suggested that the perpetrator was in 
                fact of European descent. In 2012, when it was eventually revealed that the perpetrator 
                was Jasper Steringa, a local farmer that many of the residents knew, media outlets 
                decided to lead with headlines and stories that expressed shock at the fact that a 
                local man and churchgoer could be capable of committing such a crime.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Locals who had been interviewed described Steringa as &quot;smart&quot; for the manner in 
                which he killed Vaastra because it led the community to believe that one of the 
                asylum seekers had committed the crime. M&apos;charek et al. describe phenotypic othering 
                and offender profiling as two elements that contributed to racially profiling the 
                asylum seekers. This was done through describing the slitting of throats as an 
                &quot;Arabic ritual&quot; and through the disbelief that a Dutch resident and family man 
                who was known by the community and even submitted his DNA for forensic testing 
                was actually the murderer. A local expressed how she had less peace of mind knowing 
                that he was in fact a someone who was a father within the community. From what I 
                understand, phenotypic othering is the way in which the Dutch society distanced 
                themselves from the crime. This was done through taking parts of the evidence 
                gathered at the scene of the crime and giving it characteristics that described 
                a group of people other than them. For example, the knife, blood and sperm found 
                at the scene, the way in which the victim was murdered all led the community to 
                speculate that it had to be done by someone who was not European and the existence 
                of the building of foreigners convinced the community that it had to be someone 
                from that building despite the lack of evidence and later, the evidence that disproved 
                this through forensic testing. When Steringa was named and proven to be the perpetrator, 
                the community did not look at him in terms of the local community but rather as an 
                individual who had committed a crime.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of this case study, forensic identification helped exonerate a community 
                that was racially discriminated and helped fid the perpetrator of the crime. 
                However, I do worry about what DNA that has now been proven to prove biological 
                differences in race could mean for the future. We are now witnessing the &quot;reinscription 
                of race&quot; and the &quot;molecularization of race&quot; and this information is being stored as data. 
                I hope that this data does not fall into the wrong hands and leads to unethical analysis, 
                manipulation or experimentation of DNA with regards to race. I hope that this tool is 
                used honestly to help find and persecute criminals and stop the act of racial profiling 
                as it has been proven that the profiles of people of colour have been perceived as 
                untrustworthy by white people (A Groggel et al., 2018).
