                User Experience (UX) can be described as the purpose and functionality of 
                the product and User Interface (UI) can be described as the design attributes 
                that determine how easy a website is to engage with and how well a website 
                performs. UI can include specific assets that users interact with such as 
                colours, images and typography. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a website is designed with good UX, it reduces complaints from customers 
                and increases their trust in your brand. The UX design of a website is 
                typically done first. When I think of my website, the first thing that 
                comes to mind is a consistent and clear navigation menu and the structure 
                of the website. My website relies more on visuals therefore I have 
                incorporated elements such as an image slideshow that will be present on 
                the home page, about page and blog pages that will showcase the images 
                created by Milani Media House. This reminds the viewer of what the product 
                that is being promoted is. This is my way of including visual elements 
                in the structural make-up of the website. I am also working on creating 
                an immersive gallery page in which people can feel as though they have 
                access to me work on a more intimate level. As of now, I will achieve 
                this through large 3D drawings that are from the perspective of the viewer 
                but a long-term goal of mine is to be able to embed videos of an exhibition 
                space (real or virtual with the help of 3D programs such as SketchUp).   
            </p>

                With regards to the UI, my website showcases my artistic abilities and 
                experiences in Johannesburg through exhibitions and photography of my 
                creative process. The colour palette of my website is black and white with 
                accents of bright red and a clay orange colour. The presence of the red 
                represents confidence and passion while the lighter orange colour can be 
                seen as a reference to my African context. I am still working on 
                integrating more responsive design tools into my website such as making 
                my website accessible on desktops and mobile phones. I want to be able 
                to create an experience in which users can engage with me and my work and 
                feel like they are part of my creative process and audience. I would love 
                to eventually also incorporate a comment section so that I can communicate 
                with the audience and they can feel like they have a degree of access to me.
