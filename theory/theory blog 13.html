                User Experience (UX) can be described as the purpose and functionality of 
                the product and User Interface (UI) can be described as the design attributes 
                that determine how easy a website is to engage with and how well a website 
                performs. UI can include specific assets that users interact with such as 
                colours, images and typography. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference between UX and UI is not always clear so an analogy that 
                was made by Alan Smith helped me break it down and understand it. Essentially 
                - when looking at a house - the physical structure, plumbing electrical 
                system and HVAC are the functionality and thus the UX of the house. The 
                finishes such as the windows hardware, doorknobs, faucets and paint are 
                how the homeowner interacts with the house and their enjoyment of it and 
                this is the UI. Therefore, when applied to the website context, UX can 
                be seen as the coding that helps the website run efficiently and the 
                wireframes that help plan where functions will be placed and UI can be 
                achieved through the style guides that determine colour schemes, 
                animation, imagery, buttons and typography and overall visual effects t
                hat will keep the user engaged and help them enjoy the products more.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits of UX include design that is centred around the user and 
                sees value in creating elements that allow users to have a positive e
                xperience with the product. It looks at creating a context in which users 
                can experience the website and how it showcases those products in the most 
                satisfactory and efficient way possible. When a website is designed with 
                good UX, it reduces complaints from customers and increases their 
                trust in your brand. The UX design of a website is typically done 
                first. To put it simply, UX acts as the &quot;organs&quot; of the website and 
                makes interfaces or the products that you interact with useful and 
                functional. When I think of my website, the first thing that comes 
                to mind is a consistent and clear navigation menu. I have also decided 
                to put my recent posts on the home page for ease of navigation and so 
                that returning users can quickly access the most recent information 
                instead of having to scroll through all they content they have already 
                consumed. Using good semantic markup ensures that that code reads easily 
                and thus is easy for developers to engage with and add more content to. 
                Using a consistent layout that is readable across all the pages on your 
                website (i.e., the about page, contact page and blog pages) will also 
                increase the users’ likeliness to return to your site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                UI looks at the aesthetic and interactive aspects of the website. It l
                ooks into how the product is presented to users and how users can interact 
                with the product. This means that – on a website – one would have to 
                integrate interactive mechanisms in order for the customer to feel like 
                they are part of the experience. An interactive mechanism could be a 
                button that momentarily changes colour when clicked on, a drop-down menu, 
                articles that pop out when the mouse hovers over them and websites 
                that are equally efficient and aesthetically pleasing on mobile phones. 
                Imagery helps the user see what the website represents or is trying to 
                sell to them and typography that is clean and readable but minimal in 
                text helps the user read easily but not lose interest due to the presence 
                of long sentences.  
            </p>

                My website is image based as it showcases my artistic abilities and 
                experiences in Johannesburg through exhibitions and photography of my 
                creative process. The colour palette of my website is black and white 
                with accents of bright red and a clay orange colour. The presence of 
                the red is intended to be interpreted as confidence and passion while 
                the lighter orange colour can be seen as a reference to my African context. 
                I am still working on integrating more responsive design tools into my 
                website such as buttons and a gallery page in which users can immerse 
                themselves into my work from the comfort of their own homes. I want to 
                be able to create an experience in which users can engage with me and 
                my work and feel like they are part of my creative process and audience. 
                I would love to eventually also incorporate a comment section so that 
                I can communicate with the audience and they can feel like they have a 
                degree of access to me.
