            I AM PARTICIPATING IN MY FIRST EXHIBITION!
        </p>
        <p>
            A few weeks ago I was approached by VISION GALLERY to exibit a few of 
            my pieces in their group exhibition. This is HUGE for me and I can hardly 
            contain my excitement. The theme is &quot;Contract &amp; Harmony&quot; 
            and this is perfect because my multimedia medium already embodies the theme 
            prior to the narrative of the artwork being created. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The exhbition space is small and situated in town so I want to incorporate 
            that in my choice of colour palette and layout of the art works. I will be showing 
            three A1 pieces and, although I cannot show you the offical pieces yet, I wanted 
            to share some of the early drafts and how I imagined them in the space. 
            I created a simualted digital space to show you what it could possibly look like.
        </p>

            I have also attached the poster with the details if you would like to come 
            and see the exhibition. There are so many talented artists who will also be showing 
            their work and I would love to see you all there!
        </p>
        <p>
            None of this would be possible without your support and th sharing and reposting 
            of my work so I would really like to express my gratitude for your continued support!
