        <p>
            In preparation for my upcoming exhbition, I decdied 
    to walk the streets of Johannesburg to get inspiration for my art. As a way of trying 
    to take myself out of the previous artworks I made, I decided to put the books down, leave the house, 
    and walk around the city. I had been meaning to do this for a while but the anxiety of 
    being alone, the possible harrassment and also possibly not being inspired kept me from doing it 
    for a while. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I just decided to walk and truly observe the spaces within the CBD area and also 
            in Sandton. The theme of the exhbition is contrast and harmony so the first idea that 
            came to mind was the disparities between the CBD and surburban areas. However, what stood out 
            to me were the lines that you can extract from building and people and I think my new angle 
            is looking at the contrast of organic and geometric lines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the one image, A man was playing his guitar in town and the organic nature of 
            the sound waves, the man's kindess and his posture in contrast to the very rigid and geometric 
            structure of te buildings in town really stood out to me. As human, we should look at life 
            as fluid and everchanging despite the restrictions and barriers that come our way.

            I hope you enjoy a snippet of the pictures I took.
