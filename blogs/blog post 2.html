        As an African woman, I have always had a weird relationship with where 
        I am from and where my family is from. It is weird becasue you think that 
        it would be the same place but that is not the case. I was born and raised 
        in Johannesburg with elements and cntributions from the Eastern Cape while 
        my family was born and raised in the Eastern Cape.

            &quot;The Origin Series&quot; is my exploration of where home is and 
            how I have navigated the reality of calling two places home. I feel like 
            collaging will help illustrate the contrast and juxtaposition of my two homes 
            and the texture will illustrate the &quot;reality&quot;.

            I used images of the ocean because I LOVE the ocean and feel a special 
            connection with the water and energy of the waves. I also used images of 
            the Johannesburg bridges and considered using the skyline because that is 
            what I felt best represented Johannesburg.
