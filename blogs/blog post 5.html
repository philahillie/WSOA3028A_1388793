            Creative block is something that artists are all too familiar with and it 
            is okay to go through it. The most important thing to remember is: 
        </p>
        <p>
            1. You will get through it 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Be kind to yourself and try not to put pressure on yourself
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to share advice that I have gotten from my peers and professionals on 
            this site to help other people who might be struggling to break through 
            the brick wall that is the creative block.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, what helps me is taking a break from creating and closing all 
            the Pinterest tabs. Taking a break and resting can recharge your brain and also 
            change the perspective from which you are apporaching your creative process. A professional 
            also recommended taking the creative process back to basics and drawing your 
            ideas down on paper. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very easy to find all your inspiration on social media and other digital 
            platforms such as Pinterest or Tumblr but I have found that physicall going to 
            art galleries or spaces such as a park or building can serve as a new source 
            of inspiration.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Another tip is to work through the ideas that do not turn out well. 
            It is perfectly okay to produce work that you do not connect to but I have 
            found that keeping those failed projects can be qite useful for future projects. 
            Sometimes I use elements from a failed project in a new one and connect with the 
            work more.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, the most important thing is to believe in yourself and your crazy ideas. 
            Sometimes growing into the next phase of your work is uncomfortable and you will 
            feel like you are unable to produce the work you imagine in your head. Keep on 
            pushing and do not give up on your vision. Everything always comes together at the end. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope all of this advice has been helpful. I also hope that you remember to 
            breathe and be kind to yourself. Creating artwork is a journey and the key 
            is to be present for the highs and the lows.
