            When I first started sharing my work on social media, I was scared 
            because I had no idea what people would think or if they would even care. 
            I realise now that  what was nice about intially sharing my work was that 
            I was sharing my work with my small community of followers who were my 
            friends and family. I really had no expectations in terms of my art reaching 
            a lot of people, I was content with sharing it with the 500 followers I had. 
            I had no idea that them sharing my work would lead to thousands of people seeing 
            my work and eventually approaching me to either purchase my work or ask for 
            custom work.

            Social media is such a powerful tool and I have seen artists with 200 followers 
            cross borders and grow exponentially through the act of sharing and reposting. 
            What has been truly amazing is the fact that me sharing my work on social media 
            jump-started my career as a multimedia artist. Social media was able to connect to 
            networks of people I would have never been able to connect to by myself.

            As my following grew, my friends expressed concern about the how my 
            work could easily be downloaded from platforms such as Twitter. I have also 
            noticed how easy it is for other artists work to be replicated or adapted and 
            reshared. To curb people from downloading high quality copies of artworks from 
            digital platforms, I noticed that artists will add a noise or grainy filter to their artworks 
            that affect the quality of the work.

            While your work can technically be &quot;copied&quot; by other followers or viewers, 
            I have found that when you have a community of followers who are supportive and 
            invested in your growth, your work is not stolen and, if it inspires adaptations, 
            you are approproately credited.

            I honestly believe that there is value in social media and using it to 
            grow your following and supporters. I alos think it is great practice for 
            actually committing to putting your work out there.
