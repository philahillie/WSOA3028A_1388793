            I was recently able to work with Oglivy, a talented and well known advertising agency in Johannesburg, for on a photoshoot 
            for branding and advertising for a local campaign for MTV. The brief was to create animation and 
            a cohesive overall look for a Women's day campaign in August. I was brought on as a freelance graphic designer 
            and also as an artist who will deliver a message for Women's day to motivate South African women.

            The photoshoot was held at SunshineCo. which is situated in the Keyes Art Mile in Johannesburg. 
            I am so excited to be a part of a campaign that aligns with the work that I do and also gives me 
            a platform as an artist. The photoshoot was done in a green screen style because it was going to be 
            overlayed with animation that will be done by myself and and upcoming female artists.
